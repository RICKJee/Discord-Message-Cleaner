### 📌 What is Message Cleaner?

Message Cleaner is a **lightweight, GUI-powered Discord bot manager** designed to automatically delete messages older than a specified age in your selected channels. It’s ideal for keeping logs, mod channels, or public chats clean and tidy — without needing to write code or use complex bots.

### 🛠️ How It Works

1. Paste your Discord bot token into the GUI
2. List the channel IDs you want cleaned
3. Choose how old messages must be to get deleted (in minutes)
4. Set how often to check for old messages (in seconds)

### 📍 Logs & Settings
